# lem-3d
LEM 3D is a demonstration of a lunar landing simulator. It's definitely not a polished, completed game but it does feature a simple physics engine which lets you pilot an Apollo Lunar Module down onto the surface of a small area of terrain.

When the game opens, you can press **Esc** to close it. Holding the **Left mouse button** while dragging the mouse will pan the camera and holding the **Right mouse button** while dragging will zoom in/out. The engine thrust is controlled using the **Up/Down** arrow keys while pitch, roll and yaw are controlled using **8/2**, **4/6** and **1/3** on the numpad respectively. Holding **5** on the numpad will kill all rotation.
